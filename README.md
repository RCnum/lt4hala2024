Relevant data and code to reproduce the findings in "Automatic Normalisation of Middle French and its Impact on Productivity"

# Datasets
All datasets are in the data folder.

## Hand-crafted corpus
The manually normalized corpus is `rc_manual_normalisation_lt4hala.src` and `rc_manual_normalisation_lt4hala.tgt`, for the source and target respectively. The source corpus is non-normalized, while the target corpus was manually normalized by experts. The normalization process is detailed in the paper but could be summarized as an orthographic and grammatical normalization with syntactic structures remaining untouched.
